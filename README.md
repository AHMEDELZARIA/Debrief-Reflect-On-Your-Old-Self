# Debrief, Reflec On Your Old Self
Debrief, an application that helps you reflect on your old self. Debrief makes journalling a lot more easy and memorable. Essentially, each day, the user receives a notification prompting them to answer their daily prompt. After pressing on the notification, the user will be prompted with a question where they would answer it via a video. This process would repeat every day and towards the end of each month, a montage of the user's responses will be given to them in order for them to reflect on their old self. This application is also especially useful to therapists, which they can create the prompts for their patients and therefore track their patients results each single day. Therapists don't see their patients every single day, so this is especially useful when tracking progress. This application has a lot more useful uses such as addiction tracking. Debrief, an easy way to journal. This is an early beta as this was built in 24 hours. It uses python (opencv, ffmpeg, moviepy, GUI, etc.)
